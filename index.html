    <h1>Israel’s Unfaithfulness—A Warning Example</h1>
    
    <div class="highlight">
Today, we’ll be considering a serious and sobering topic: "Israel’s Unfaithfulness—A Warning Example." We’ll look into the mistakes of the Israelites and how their actions serve as a warning for us today. Let’s allow this week's treasures from God's word to stir within us the desire to avoid their mistakes and remain faithful to Jehovah, constantly meditating on His blessings in our lives—past, present, and future.

</div>

    <h2>1. Israel Forgot Jehovah’s Wonderful Works</h2>
    <p>
        Let’s begin with <span class="scripture">Psalm 78:11, 42 [ lets read the bible chapter and verses ]</span>, <div class="highlight">11. They also forgot what he had done, His wonderful works that he showed them. 42. They did not remember his power, The day that he rescued them from the adversary, </div>.
Despite the countless miracles Jehovah performed for them, from their deliverance from Egypt to their survival in the wilderness, the Israelites frequently forgot these marvelous deeds. They failed to keep Jehovah’s works at the forefront of their minds, which led them to test God again and again, causing Him grief.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>Watchtower</i> of December 1, 1996, reminds us that this forgetfulness was not just a mental lapse; it was a heart issue. Because they did not remember Jehovah’s mighty acts, they pained Him and eventually faced His rejection. Jesus himself highlighted this when he said, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone," warning of Israel's rejection due to their unfaithfulness (<span class="scripture">Matthew 21:42, 43</span>).
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
        So, what can we learn from this? The psalmist gives us the answer in <span class="scripture">Psalm 77:11, 12  [ lets read the bible chapter and verses ]</span>
<div class="highlight">11. I will remember the works of Jah; I will remember your marvelous deeds of long ago.12. And I will meditate on all your activity And ponder over your dealings.</div>

 Meditating on Jehovah’s past deeds, especially those that have impacted our lives, will protect us from spiritual amnesia. Let’s make it a habit to recall how Jehovah has blessed and guided us. This will strengthen our faith and give us the motivation to continue walking in His ways.
    </div>

    <h2>2. Israel Did Not Appreciate Jehovah’s Provisions</h2>
    <p>
        Next, let’s turn our attention to <span class="scripture">Psalm 78:19 [ lets read the bible chapter and verses ] </span>, <div class="highlight">19. So they spoke against God, Saying: “Can God spread a table in the wilderness?”</div>
<div class="highlight">
	<strong>Now focusing on the artwork. the before is on a transparent blue background and the after of a white background. who do we see in there, an ungrateful Israelite.</strong>
	
Despite having witnessed Jehovah’s miraculous provision of manna and water, they doubted His ability to care for them. Their lack of appreciation led to murmuring, which ultimately distanced them from Jehovah.</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>Watchtower</i> of July 15, 2006, addresses the dangers of murmuring. It points out that when we complain, we focus on our problems and push Jehovah’s blessings into the background. This can lead us to become ungrateful, just as the Israelites did. But how can we avoid this pitfall?
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
        We must keep Jehovah’s blessings at the forefront of our minds. Think about it: We have the privilege of bearing Jehovah’s name, having a close relationship with Him, and understanding the vital issue of universal sovereignty. These are blessings that should fill our hearts with gratitude and leave no room for complaints. When we focus on these blessings, our faith in Jehovah’s provisions will grow, and we will trust Him to care for us in every circumstance.
    </div>

    <h2>3. The Israelites Did Not Learn From Their Errors</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, let’s consider <span class="scripture">Psalm 78:40, 41, 56, 57. [ lets read the bible chapter and verses ]  </span><div class="highlight">
        	
40. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness And made him feel hurt in the desert! 

41. Again and again they put God to the test, And they grieved the Holy One of Israel.

56. But they kept challenging God the Most High, and rebelling against him; They did not pay attention to his reminders.

57. They also turned away and were as treacherous as their forefathers. They were as unreliable as a loose bow.</div>. 

These verses highlight how the Israelites repeatedly rebelled against Jehovah, showing a pattern of unfaithfulness. They didn’t learn from their mistakes but continued to test God, bringing Him grief.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>Watchtower</i> of July 1, 2011, explains that their rebellion was like that of a disobedient child who continually hurts his parents. Despite Jehovah’s mercy and willingness to forgive, the Israelites kept returning to their old ways. This behavior deeply pained Jehovah, as they failed to demonstrate genuine repentance.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
        So, what will help us avoid being unfaithful to Jehovah? We must learn from Israel’s mistakes by recognizing the importance of consistency in our worship. We should regularly reflect on our actions, ensuring that we are not falling into a pattern of disobedience or complacency. Meditating on Jehovah’s past acts of kindness, His present guidance, and His future promises will strengthen our resolve to stay on the right path.
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, brothers and sisters, the account of Israel’s unfaithfulness serves as a powerful warning for us today. Let’s not forget Jehovah’s wonderful works, fail to appreciate His provisions, or repeat the mistakes of unfaithfulness. Instead, let us continually meditate on Jehovah’s blessings in our lives—past, present, and future. This meditation will stir our hearts and minds, helping us to stay faithful and avoid the pitfalls that led to Israel’s downfall. Let’s choose the path of faithfulness, knowing that Jehovah will bless our efforts and guide us in His ways.
